                        Learning, stubborn persistence...and more learning. 
                        That's what has usually driven me, whether as a writer, 
                        a developer, a teacher, a coach or anything else I've been and 
                        done up until now.

                        I'm excited about building things. I love to explore. 
                        I'm looking for a great team to build great things with 
                        and learn a ton from. I love creating things with the 
                        MERN stack, but I'm also looking forward to adding new 
                        languages and skills to my tool chest.
                    </p>

                        I live near Portland, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, 
                        but I've worked either fully or partially remote for many years. 
                        I couldn't be more excited about this next step in my career 
                        as a software developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have an MFA in creative writing, and I taught college level writing 
                        for a number of years. I love reading and writing, and I also truly 
                        love teaching.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been building on the web for decades, but much of that time has been 
                        focused on solving business problems for clients quickly and easily 
                        for them, which is how I became a Joomla expert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also worked for an IBM business partner as a systems engineer setting 
                        up large backup and recovery systems for clients of all sizes. That's 
                        where I learned to love the command line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm looking for an opportunity to grow into a true full stack developer 
                        on an amazing team with people who also love to teach and share knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've made my own furniture, brewed my own beer, and played a lot of really 
                        terrible music, hockey, and golf with friends over the years...and I hope to do a lot more 
                        of that in years to come.
                    </p>
